Problem Statement-

PSTakeCare has a huge dataset of hospitals. Each hospital can have its own "open timing". Open timings can be one of these
24*7
24*7 except weekends
24*7 except Sunday or a particular day
Two or more slots per day (e.g. [9:30 AM to 12:30 PM] and [2:00 PM to 6:00 PM])
Two or more slots per day except weekends or some days
Write a function which takes timings as json and gives output as string.
